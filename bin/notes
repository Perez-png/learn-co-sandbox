CLI ruby (class favbattles::CLI)

        This is How we do it in Cedar Creek
1. Must be at least two levels deep
2. Must have an API scraper
3. Get information from API and save it into objects

        And this is how it will happen
        
1. Pick an API (favbattles)
2. Make sure we can get all information needed from said API to build this application
3. Start formulating ideas on what to partake


        Flow of favbattles
1. Welcome user to favbattles
2. Ask user about specific terms they would like to look up.
3. I will ge tthis information from the API, save it, so I can get it later and then dislplay all of the definitions? or perhaps examples.
4. I will then allow the user to chose the definition that best assists or fits their needs which can then tell them more information about the topic at hand.
